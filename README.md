In this project, MRI images are compared and colored according to their intensity with GUI in Java.

Firstly, the database connection should be provided with phpmyadmin correctly. After that in the main panel of the project you are able to
choose a file or an image. It will take the icons of images and their names. These are provided in deneme2.java file. Then you will be able
to choose the image that you want to analyse. After that, you can select any area from image and see the selected part. Also, it will 
automatically show the lowest intensity area and highest intensity area. You can select maximum 4 area. Then when you click analyse it will 
show results as a graph. Therefore you should have graph library which is already in the library folder. Finally you can color your 
selected area according to its intensity.
